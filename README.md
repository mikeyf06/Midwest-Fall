# CustomTheme - Midwest Fall

---

## Description 

Visual Studio theme meant to showcase the Midwestern Fall vibes. Throw on a hoodie, and get to coding. Good luck. 
README generated by our AI overlords. Blame them if it looks bad or is hard to understand in some spots, I think it's fine though lol.

> **Target:** Visual Studio 2019/2022 (Windows).

## Getting the VSIX (Installable Theme)

There are two common ways to get an installable theme inside Visual Studio.

### Option A: Build a VSIX from this `.vstheme` (recommended)
1. **Install Microsoft's "Color Theme Designer"** extension in Visual Studio.  
2. **Create a VSTheme project:**  
   - `File > New > Project` > search for **"VSTheme Project"** and create it.  
3. **Add the theme file:**  
   - Add `CustomTheme.vstheme` to the project (or replace the default theme file).  
4. **Build the project:**  
   - The compiled **.vsix** appears under `bin\Debug` or `bin\Release`.  
5. **Install it:**  
   - Double-click the `.vsix` to install into Visual Studio.

### Option B: Use an existing `.vsix`
If your repo includes a built `.vsix` (under `releases/` or `bin/`), just double-click it to install.  
*(If you don't see one, use Option A to build it.)*

## Applying the Theme in Visual Studio

After installation:

1. Open **Visual Studio**.  
2. Go to **Tools → Options → Environment → General**.  
3. Choose your theme under **Color theme**.

---

## Tweaking / Extending

- Want even **deeper contrasts** (e.g., darker comments or bolder keywords)? Adjust the hex values above and re-build the VSIX.  
- You can define **language-specific** tweaks (C#, JS/TS, Razor, XAML) via the appropriate color tokens in the theme file.  
- If you prefer a slightly cooler or warmer look, nudge hues by ~5-8% and keep background `#FEF5E2` for legibility.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Theme doesn't appear in the list:** ensure the VSIX installed without errors (restart VS).  
- **Only some colors changed:** Visual Studio has multiple "Text Editor" categories (MEF/Language Service/Marker). Make sure tokens are updated in the editor-related categories.  
- **Using VS Code?** This theme targets *Visual Studio*, not VS Code (which uses JSON color themes).
